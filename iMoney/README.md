# iMoney App

This app is based on Firebase database. Users can upload their daily spendings and earnings with this app. It is the final project of course CSE 438 at WUSTL completed by a team of 3 members. 

Use a valid email address to register a new account so that if someday you forget your password, you can reset it by varifying
your email. You can add and delete accounts, such as your 'cash', 'BoA debit card' etc. Also, multiple categories of daily
spendings are offered, and based on which statistics function can tell you your spending breakdown structure. You can review 
the receipt pictures on cloud. Moreover, footprints of your spendings are recorded so you can check out parts of your spending
records by geographical sorting. Sharing and sending feedbacks are enabled in the setting page.
